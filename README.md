Project Name: Grocery App

As we can't remember everything, users frequently forget to buy the things they want to buy. However, with the assistance of this app, you can make a list of the groceries you intend to buy so that you don't forget anything.
So I have created Grocery App which help us to remember grocery items which we have purchased .
We can add grocery items ,quantity of that grocery item and  price of that item. After that in app it will show us grocery item name, quantity and addition of price of how many quantity you purchased.


Thank you for giving opportunity to join this excellent program.
